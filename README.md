# EXP:1 Implementing various effects in a material such as emissive, roughness and metallic properties in Unreal Engine

# Aim
To implement and demonstrate various material effects in Unreal Engine, including emissive, roughness, and metallic properties, using the Material Editor.

# Procedure
   # 1. Create a New Material:
         Open Unreal Engine.
         In the Content Browser, right-click and select Material.
         Name it M_EffectsDemo.
   # 2. Apply Base Color:
         Open the material.
         Add a Vector Parameter or Constant3Vector node and connect it to the Base Color input. 
   # 3. Add Emissive Effect:
         Add a Multiply node.
         Connect a Constant3Vector (for emissive color) and a Scalar Parameter (for intensity).
         Connect the result to the Emissive Color input.
   # 4. Control Roughness:
         Add a Scalar Parameter node and connect it to the Roughness input.
         Lower values = shinier surface, higher values = rougher surface.   
   # 5. Control Metallic Property:
         Add a Scalar Parameter node and connect it to the Metallic input.
         0 = non-metal, 1 = fully metallic.
   # 6. Save and Apply Material:
         Save the material.
         Apply it to any mesh in the scene (like a sphere or cube) to preview the results.

# Result
    Successfully implemented a material in Unreal Engine showcasing:

         Emissive glow using emissive color and intensity.
         Variable surface roughness to simulate different textures.
         Metallic appearance adjustment to reflect light like real-world metals.
         
This setup enables dynamic, realistic materials suitable for use in environments, characters, and VFX in Unreal Engine projects.
